The project describes working with a MySQL database using the Hibernate library.

The main tasks of the project have been completed:
1. Classes corresponding to the database tables have been created.
2. Logic for working with the classes and translating actions with the database using the Hibernate library has been added.
3. The database structure was not changed as per the assignment.

Suggestions for improving the structure:
1. There is no foreign key in the FilmText table.
2. The Film and FilmText tables have identical columns. It makes sense to eliminate the FilmText table as all necessary information is already present in the Film table.
3. Films can have multiple languages. It would be logical to move the language information to a separate table with a ManyToMany relationship between films and languages.
4. Data from the SpecialFeatures column should be moved to a separate table. Create a Features table where genres can be added, and a separate table for linking films and genres.
5. The Customer, Staff, and Actor tables have identical columns for first_name and last_name. It would be more appropriate to create a separate table for individuals, 
which can then be linked to Customer, Staff, and Actor tables through an ID.
